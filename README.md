Python Web Framework @ SoftUni

This repo was created for the 'Python Web Framework' course at SoftUni. It contains Django project which is my web app for the final exam.

The idea behind the project is to create a online shop for aquarium fishes. Fishes are putted in different categories.
The applicatian has a user registration functionality with email activation. User can filter and search for specific fish and can add it to the cart.
Cart functionality consist of ability to add or decrease the amount of the chosen fish, delete the product as well.
Payment functionality was not developed in that repo. 
The project app uses environment variables to hide sensitive information.

DISCLAIMER: This app is not a fully operational product, it's not intended for commercial use and has many features that haven't been properly tested or developed.
